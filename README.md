## Acknowledgments

Firstly, we thank Prof. Mauro Galetti and Prof. Milton Ribeiro, from the State University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, who started the [Atlantic Series of data papers](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/toc/10.1002/(ISSN)1939-9170.AtlanticPapers) and inspired our entire community to take their data out of their drawers. Our labmates and colleagues helped us at different stages of this project. Our sponsors, especially the Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung, CNPq, CAPES, and FAPESP, gave us grants, fellowships, and scholarships. Last, but not least, we thank the [Stack Overflow Community](https://stackoverflow.com), where we solve most of our coding dilemmas.
