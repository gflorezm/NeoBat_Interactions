## Acknowledgments

Firstly, we thank Mauro Galetti and Milton Ribeiro, from the Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Brazil, who led the [Atlantic Series of data papers](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/toc/10.1002/(ISSN)1939-9170.AtlanticPapers) and inspired our entire community to share data collected over decades. Our labmates and colleagues helped us at different stages of this project. Our sponsors, especially the Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung (AvH), Brazilian Council of Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES), São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), and Research Dean of the University of São Paulo (PRP-USP), gave us grants, fellowships, and scholarships. Last, but not least, we thank the [Stack Overflow Community](https://stackoverflow.com), where we solve most of our coding dilemmas.
